## Summary

This is a simple productivity app that allows users to plan their day. After logging in, the user is welcomed and given a motivating quote of the day. Scrolling down, the user sees a 5-day forecast. Finally under the weather is a simple todo list where the user can add and delete items as they're completed. I intend to add more features to this app that go along with the productivity theme.
